1. SERVICE OVERVIEW
============================================================

Purpose:
- A web-based platform that lets users upload, organize, and share travel photos in a timeline/space-based structure.
- Automatically detects photo shooting time and location (EXIF metadata), then groups photos accordingly.
- Offers AI-generated travel summaries, allowing users to easily share a cohesive travel story on social media.

Key Use Cases:
1. Quickly upload bulk travel photos taken on a smartphone.
2. Automatically group photos by time/date and geographic location.
3. Let users add place names and brief reviews or ratings for each grouped segment.
4. Generate a complete travel log in chronological and spatial order, integrating user feedback.
5. Use a Large Language Model (LLM) to create an AI-generated narrative of the entire trip.
6. Share the final narrative and photos on social media through a unique link or direct integration (Web Share API, etc.).

Target Audience:
- Travelers who want an easy way to create and share personal travel stories online.
- Individuals who prefer an automated approach (EXIF-driven grouping + AI summary) but still want editing options.

2. CORE FEATURES
============================================================

1. Photo Upload & EXIF Extraction
   - Users select or drag-and-drop multiple images (JPEG/HEIC) for upload.
   - The system reads EXIF metadata (e.g., DateTimeOriginal, GPS) on the client side to identify timestamps and locations.

2. Automatic Grouping (Time & Location)
   - Photos are automatically clustered based on shooting times and geographic proximity (e.g., “within 2 hours and 5 km”).
   - Users can manually split or merge groups if needed.

3. Group Annotation & Reviews
   - Each group is assigned a place name or landmark (e.g., “Eiffel Tower”) and a short review or rating.
   - Optional reverse geocoding to suggest place names from GPS coordinates.

4. Timeline/Spatial Organization
   - The entire trip is presented as a timeline, with day-by-day or location-by-location breakdown.
   - Users see a visual structure of their trip, combining date/time with map-based or region-based grouping.

5. AI-Generated Travel Log
   - The user’s grouped data (dates, places, reviews) is sent to an LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT) for a cohesive, narrative-style travel summary.
   - Produces an initial draft that the user can edit and refine.

6. Editor & Finalization
   - An editing interface allows users to adjust the AI-generated text, add extra details, or insert photos within the text.
   - Changes are saved so the user can revisit and update at any time.

7. Sharing & Social Media Integration
   - Generate a unique shareable link (e.g., https://service.com/share/123abc).
   - Allows easy posting to social media via Web Share API or direct links to Twitter/Facebook/etc.
   - Public or private sharing options (isPublic flag).

8. Read-Only Shared Page
   - Anyone accessing the share link can view the compiled travel log, AI-generated narrative, and relevant photos in a user-friendly page.
   - Mobile-responsive design for consistent viewing across devices.
